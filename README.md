# Waterparks Website
Waterparks was a website that I worked on during my senior year of high school with two of my classmates. The purpose was to create a website that listed all of the known waterparks in the United States. We never managed to finish the website, but we learned a lot and got to mess with some cool API.

The thing I liked most about working on this website was the abilty to use a JavaScript API that allowed me to present a map of the United States. A user could then click on any state that he or she wanted and view a list of the known waterparks in that state along with their location and website if they had one.

The waterparks were input into a database so that they could easily be added, removed, edited, and filtered. We used PHP to link a MySQL database to the website, and when a user clicked on a state, it would make a database request for all waterparks with the appropriate state abbreviation.
